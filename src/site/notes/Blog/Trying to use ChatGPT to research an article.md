(This article is still being written, check later for update information!)

So, today [I tooted](https://mas.to/@moof/109493421824493330) about [some](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFgqSUwC/) [videos](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFgqSttt/) by Riley Brown on tiktok of all places on how to use #ChatGPT and #Obsidian as a way to kick off research.

Seeing as I'm a little stagnated on an article I want to write, I thought I'd try it out and blog the experience.

# The Premise
Last week I tooted [a thread on the closure announcement of TradeLens](https://mas.to/@moof/109432125072460279), and I felt that to do it proper justice, I should explain in more detail what an [[Logistics/Electronic Bills of Lading\|Electronic Bill Of Lading]] is, and why the main issues around digitalisation of logistics documentation is not technological but legal, and so I created that note in Obsidian, and left some placeholder text to the toot thread.

This note needs expanding, and so I thought that I'd try out the method in the videos. For what it's worth, I do have a background in Logistics, though I am not an expert in this particular field, I do think I know more than the average person.

So, [with a chai horchattÃ© and a chocolate croissant](https://mas.to/@moof/109494340699992753) to accompany me, I set off to try this out.

# First question
So, [the video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFgqSUwC/) posits that you need to ask ChatGPT a somewhat leading question that allows you to go further, so copying his example: 

**Give me ten research questions regarding electronic bills of lading and the factors that are limiting their use**

> 1.  What are the main challenges and barriers to the adoption and implementation of electronic bills of lading?
> 2.  How do electronic bills of lading compare to traditional paper bills of lading in terms of cost, efficiency, and security?
> 3.  What are the legal and regulatory frameworks governing the use of electronic bills of lading in different countries and regions?
> 4.  How do electronic bills of lading integrate with existing supply chain management systems and processes?
> 5.  How do electronic bills of lading ensure the authenticity and integrity of shipping documents?
> 6.  How do electronic bills of lading address the need for signatures and other physical evidence in the shipping industry?
> 7.  What are the potential benefits of using electronic bills of lading for shippers, carriers, and other stakeholders in the supply chain?
> 8.  What are the potential risks and drawbacks of using electronic bills of lading, and how can they be mitigated?
> 9.  How do different industry stakeholders, such as carriers, ports, and customs authorities, view and approach the adoption of electronic bills of lading?
> 10.  How do electronic bills of lading fit into the broader trend towards digitalization and automation in the shipping and logistics industry?

That's a very broad list of questions, but then again I didn't limit the question much.

The video then suggests I paste that list of questions into Obsidian, which I did, into the [[Logistics/Electronic Bills of Lading\|Electronic Bills of Lading]] note, and then paste it back again into ChatGPT and then press the button to get answers.

And I got, well, an answer:

> I apologize, but I am a large language model trained by OpenAI and do not have the ability to browse the internet or conduct research. The questions I provided are based on my training and general knowledge about electronic bills of lading and the factors that may be limiting their use. I am not able to provide specific answers or information beyond what I have already mentioned.

Which was honest, but not really helpful, and not what the video promised at all.

Thankfully there's a helpful "Try Again" button which yielded a much more verbose response:

> 1.  Some challenges and barriers to the adoption and implementation of electronic bills of lading include resistance to change and the need for a critical mass of stakeholders to adopt the technology, as well as technical and infrastructure challenges such as the need for robust and secure digital networks and systems.
> 2.  Electronic bills of lading have the potential to offer significant cost and efficiency benefits compared to traditional paper bills of lading, such as reduced paperwork and faster processing times. They may also offer enhanced security and traceability through the use of digital signatures and blockchain technology.
> 3.  The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the use of electronic bills of lading vary by country and region. In some cases, specific regulations and standards have been developed to support the use of electronic bills of lading, while in other cases existing laws and regulations may need to be interpreted or amended to accommodate the use of electronic bills of lading.
> 4.  Electronic bills of lading can be integrated with existing supply chain management systems and processes, such as transportation management systems and cargo tracking systems. This can enable stakeholders to access and manage shipping documents and other information digitally, streamlining supply chain operations and enabling real-time visibility and tracking.
> 5.  Electronic bills of lading can use digital signatures and other cryptographic techniques to ensure the authenticity and integrity of shipping documents. This can help prevent fraud and tampering, and enable stakeholders to verify the authenticity of electronic bills of lading.
> 6.  Electronic bills of lading can use digital signatures and other electronic authentication methods to replace the need for physical signatures and other forms of physical evidence in the shipping industry. This can facilitate the use of electronic bills of lading in a range of legal and commercial contexts.
> 7.  Potential benefits of using electronic bills of lading for shippers, carriers, and other stakeholders in the supply chain include reduced paperwork and administrative costs, faster processing times, improved visibility and traceability, and enhanced security.
> 8.  Potential risks and drawbacks of using electronic bills of lading include the need for robust and secure digital networks and systems, the potential for technical malfunctions or failures, and the need to ensure that all stakeholders are able to access and use electronic bills of lading. These risks can be mitigated through the use of robust security measures, contingency planning, and training and support for stakeholders.
> 9.  Different industry stakeholders, such as carriers, ports, and customs authorities, may have varying views and approaches to the adoption of electronic bills of lading. Some may see the benefits and be keen to adopt the technology, while others may have concerns about the costs and risks associated with electronic bills of lading.
> 10.  Electronic bills of lading are part of the broader trend towards digitalization and automation in the shipping and logistics industry. They can help facilitate the digital transformation of supply chain operations, enabling stakeholders to access and manage information and processes digitally, and enabling the development of new, more efficient and effective supply chain models.

These answers are very fluffy, there's not a lot of substance to them. 

The video then extols the virtues of going through the list and creating links to notes as a way to expand on some ideas, and build your document graph in Obsidian.
