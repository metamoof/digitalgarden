dg-publish: true

I've only really begun getting started with this website, so right now, it's all very basic.

I write my notes in [Obsidian][https://obsidian.md/] - a Markdown-based note taking application. I am still very much working on my methodology.

When a note is ready to publish, I place the text `dg-publish: true` into the front matter of the article

I use the [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) to manage the publishing of my articles. It currently is still a manual process, and I'm not sure I want to change that. I do have my Obsidian Vault synchronised over [Obsidian-Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) so that I can edit it just as easily on my iOS devices as on my Windows Desktop

This uploads the content to my [Digital Garden repository on github](https://github.com/metamoof/digitalgarden) which then automatically deploys to my website on [Netlify](netlify.com) through some magic I'm unsure I understand yet.

I'm using the  [Obsidian Primary Theme by Cecilila May](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary) as a starting point before I start theming it more to my needs.

I have a number of ideas on what I want to do with this site, and I detail them in [[Meta/Web Presence Wrangling\|Web Presence Wrangling]]. I fully expect this workflow to change.
