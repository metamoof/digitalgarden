I think I picked the wrong Mastodon Server.

I didn't know it at the time, but nevertheless, I'm uneasy with the choice I made.

At first, it was just because I wanted to get onto Mastodon. It was when everybody thought twitter was going to fail, because all the staff that ran the show were being fired or had quit, and so there was a certain amount of urgency. The day that I did it, I had a crisis at work, I also had a massive budget meeting that day, and I was travelling to Amsterdam that evening, so there was the sort of sense of Urgency that my [[ADHD Brain\|ADHD Brain]] thrives on and goes into multi-tasking mode. What's more, the various guides for migration kept saying that picking the instance was an important thing, but didn't really tell you why, or how.

This note is a very expanded version of a [thread I posted on Mastodon about this issue](https://mas.to/@moof/109412464289361914)

# Finding Instances
I had a look at [instances.social](https://instances.social/) as that was the recommended way to do so. And I was lost. I've come to the conclusion that that website isn't useful for the newbie really, beyond showing you that there is a diverse number of instances out there. What's more, some of the data was out of date. 

Much more useful was 

# Picking a "surname"
My main criterion for picking an instance was that it didn't "brand" me as something that would end up being an assumed part of my identity by merely reading my mastodon address. **First impressions are important.** So, whilst I am a queer geek, I don't want an [@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/) address, because it's not the defining part of my identity, and I certainly am not living the mainstream "queer lifestyle". Similarly, I didn't want to go to [@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/) because whilst I like open source software, I'm not fanatical about it, and don't want people to think that because I have that address.

This concern was later vindicated by my friend Matt who tooted:

>One of the things I'm really digging in [#mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/tags/mastodon) and the [#fediverse](https://fosstodon.org/tags/fediverse) is that the server someone's on really helps you to get the vibe of someone quickly. I'm on Fosstodon and I care about Foss. That's a real easy indicator and it's super social.

So, given I couldn't decide what to choose based on what servers my friends were on, and that I couldn't pick an instance at the time that looked like the right "surname", and there were assurances that one could change instances later, I decided to go for something innocuous, and short, and hence I signed up to [mas.to](https://mas.to)

# The local tab
Mastodon instances allow you to explore your personal feed, made up of the people you follow, the Local tab, made up of toots of people on that server who are publicly discoverable, and then the Federated tab, where the toots of the people on other instances that are followed by the people on that instance (the friends of friends) appear.

I'm still new to Mastodon, but I get the feeling that on smaller instances, the Local tab serves as a sort of community multiplier, you get to see what is on the mind of the people in your small community. Not all servers publicly share that tab, but it turns out that those that do can be browsed, either on the web or on some mobile clients, so you *can* get a sense for it there. I [recently spent a pleasant morning](https://mas.to/@moof/109447861982066581) browsing the [pkm.social public local feed](https://pkm.social/public/local), and it was interesting to see people riff off each other and talk with similar interests. 

That being said, that is a very niche instance, and I could get a similar feed by [browsing the #pkm tag](https://mas.to/tags/pkm) but then you miss out on the stuff that *isn't* covered by that tag. Either way, it gives a taste. 

So, yes, I feel that I'm missing out on that sense of "instance local" community. I don't know how much of that flavour is going to survive after the massive twitter influx, to be honest, but I'm keeping my eye out for small servers that I like the look of.

# The other alternative - Vanity domains
Some people run their own instance and have vanity domains as part of their online presence. The person I first noticed doing this was Simon Willison, [who wrote a blog post about how he did it](https://til.simonwillison.net/mastodon/custom-domain-mastodon), but there have been others I've seen do it, too.

I can't deny there's a certain appeal to it - my email address can also be my fediverse address, and I can eventually hack it so other fediverse systems also work off that address. I can see a future where there is a sort of "personal online presence" portal which handles ActivityPub, Blogging or Digital Garden, Image/video sharing, a la instagram/tiktok. There's probably something out there already.

On the downside, it loses the local flavour, and I'm not sure that the Federated tab is much more useful than the Home tab, so you lose discoverability. Also, it means you have to pay for and run your own server, which is an online lifetime commitment, as whilst you *can* move to a separate instance and take your followers and following with you, you can't take your toots with you. 

The alternative is a sort of "Online Alias", the way [jwz does it](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/using-your-own-domain-as-a-mastodon-handle/), or [others](https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2022/11/05/mastodon-own-donain-without-hosting-server.html) [I](https://philna.sh/blog/2022/11/23/alias-your-mastodon-username-to-your-own-domain-with-jekyll/) [found](https://domenicoluciani.com/2022/11/19/how-to-create-mastodon-alias.html)  that will allow people to search for you as your email address, but in fact just redirect to your actual account. So people could search for me as @moof@metamoof.net and end up at @moof@mas.to but that's not as cool. 

# Online legacy
There's an issue about online legacy. The downside to smaller servers is that they'll eventually die, and you can't take your toots with you. So if a hobbyist sysadmin decides to give up, then your toots will disappear online with that server. And that is bad if you still have an online presence that you've spent years building up.

This is a particular issue with a personal server. When the owner decides to stop maintaining it, will someone choose to take it all over, or will it be lost to the ether?

I hope there is a mastodon archive project out there, that will preserve backups of influential and important people's posts. Maybe also a Mastodon static file server to preserve a legacy instance, but not allow new toots. This could be useful for smaller instances too. 

# Server reliability
One other reason I'm not sure about staying on mas.to is that the server is still a bit flaky. As I write this, the instance is down and non-functional. I think that by accepting all comers during the twitter migration it's a bit oversubscribed, and whilst the admin is lovely, I'm not sure they realise what they've let themselves in for, or are certain they know how to cope. I haven't heard others complain about their instance uptime, so I'm pretty sure this is an admin issue on my instance.

# Where do I move to, then?
I'm still considering the move. The reliability issues alone are a good reason to do so. 

I only want to move once, if I can possibly manage that. 

I considered starting my own instance, maybe with a domain based around the idea of a nice cup of tea and a sit down, which is more of a whimsical "surname" than a politically/socially loaded one. But I suspect I'm too lazy to take on that responsibility, at least as a community instance.

I might still look at the personal server idea - I can pay masto.host to host it - but I'm not sure I want that lifetime commitment.
