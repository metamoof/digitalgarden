This is mostly a placeholder, as I fully expect to expand a little on my [Thread on eBLs and Blockchain from the other day](https://mas.to/@moof/109432125072460279)

# First things first, what is a bill of lading?
A bill of lading is a document that is used in the shipping industry. It acts as a contract between the person or company sending goods (the shipper) and the person or company transporting the goods (the carrier). The bill of lading lists important information about the shipment, such as what is being shipped and where it is going. It also serves as a receipt, showing that the carrier has received the goods from the shipper. In some cases, the bill of lading can also be used as a "document of title", a kind of ownership document, allowing the person or company receiving the goods (the consignee) to take possession of them when they arrive at their destination.

A bill of lading can also be used to settle disputes or prove that the goods were delivered in good condition. It can also be used as collateral for a loan or to transfer ownership of the goods. Sometimes, customs officials might also need to see the bill of lading in order to clear the goods for import or export.
