# Hi! I'm Moof, also known as Giles Antonio Radford 
I'm a software engineer, and I develop boring systems for interesting businesses. 

I work in the Logistics sector, in Barcelona, Spain. I'm British-ish and I speak English, Spanish, French and Catalan fluently (mostly). I'm queer, and my pronouns are he/him, el, il/lui, en/es. I am an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction. I also drink oodles (and oolongs!) of Tea.

This website is my own personal Digital Garden. Like all gardens when they start, it's a little sparse at the moment, but I'm starting to lay some seeds, so expect to see more, and more interesting posts as time goes by
