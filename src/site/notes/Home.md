# Hi! I'm Moof, also known as Giles Antonio Radford 
I'm a software engineer, and I develop boring systems for interesting businesses. 

I work in the Logistics sector, in Barcelona, Spain. I'm British-ish and I speak English, Spanish, French and Catalan fluently (mostly). I'm queer, and my pronouns are he/him, Ã©l/le, il/lui, en/es. I am an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction. I also drink oodles (and oolongs!) of Tea.

This website is my own personal Digital Garden. Like all gardens when they start, it's a little sparse at the moment, but I'm starting to lay some seeds, so expect to see more, and more interesting posts as time goes by

You can also find me on <a rel="me" href="https://mas.to/@moof">Mastodon</a> and I was also available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/moof), though that's more of a historical archive these days.
